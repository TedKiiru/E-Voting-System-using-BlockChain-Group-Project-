# E-Voting-System-using-BlockChain-Group-Project-
My group and I worked on this project called E-Voting System. We implemented the Block Chain for the system from scratch by using JavaScript.

Voting is a method for a group of individuals to make a collective decision or voice their cumulative opinion to arrive at a consensus. The results of a vote can have far reaching consequences due to which it is imperative to maintain integrity by ensuring that there is no scope for fraud or cheating to occur while the votes are being cast. It is highly crucial that voting is carried out in a fair and just manner.



Once the Voter has logged in to the system using their valid username and password, they can view the upcoming elections and the candidates contesting the election. Users can also view results once the elections have concluded.






In this system, the admin is the sole authority to manage elections, candidates and voters. Admin can also view the votes. Admin can also check if any vote is tampered, thus checking and verifying the block. Voter can view Elections and cast their vote, also can view the winner but cannot see the winning ratio or votes etc. The system uses Blockchain technology to create a block of every vote thus protecting its identity.
