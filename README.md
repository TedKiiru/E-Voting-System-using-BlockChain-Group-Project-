Voting is a method for a group of individuals to make a collective decision or voice their cumulative opinion to arrive at a consensus. The results of a vote can have far reaching consequences due to which it is imperative to maintain integrity by ensuring that there is no scope for fraud or cheating to occur while the votes are being cast. It is highly crucial that voting is carried out in a fair and just manner.



Once the Voter has logged in to the system using their valid username and password, they can view the upcoming elections and the candidates contesting the election. Users can also view results once the elections have concluded.



Since this system maintains the data using blockchain, it is highly dependable and can be easily scanned to check for signs of tampering and malpractice.
